When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If I wanted to share my project with someone else, or if I wanted to make it public.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
I may not want every feature that someone uploads to a repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Forks exist only on GitHub.com and are really just clones of someone else's project. I would use this as a way of making changes to someone else's project that I did not have edit rights to.
	Clones are copies of a git repository. I would use this as a way getting a new copy of a repository on my local computer.
	branches can only be created on a local repository. They can be pushed back up to GitHub after they have been committed or merged.

	What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	You can compare the changes made to the remote without incorporating those changes into the local copy.

	How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	Without GitHub, I would have to save files under new file names and send them off for review and editing. It would be much harder to track who had done what and when.

	When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
	A separate branch allows for development of additions/changes that may not work out. If the additions/changes do not work out, it is simple to delete the branch and not worry about having made changes to the master project.
